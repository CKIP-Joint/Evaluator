# Evaluator
We follow [HELM](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm) to build our evaluators.  
Please following the [instruction](https://crfm-helm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code/) to add them to your clone of HELM.  
You should put all files in `scenarios` into `helm/src/helm/benchmark/scenarios` and put `restricted` in the root of HELM.
